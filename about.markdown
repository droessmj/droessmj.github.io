Thanks for checking out my blog! I'm hoping to capture some of the hard fought lessons I've learned in hopes of helping others avoid the same mistakes. 

I'm currently a product owner dabbling in both Cloud Native and Hybrid Cloud workstreams for a large financial services company based in the Midwest. Prior to being a product owner, I was a software engineer in a variety of infrastructure-first roles including Content Management, IAM/SSO/Encryption services, and our Cloud Native Platform Development team. 

I spend a lot of time in Azure working with technical items such as IAM, Networking, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and C# and PowerShell platform guardrails (Runbooks, Functions, AKS containers) and non-technical items such as Mergers & Acquistions, Data Classification and Governance, and, last but most definitely not least, Cost Management topics (allocations, efficiences, architectural and control decisions and their impact at scale). 

In addition to the work experience above, I hold a CISSP, CCSP, Azure Expert Solutions Architect, and AWS Associate Solutions Architect certifications. As I write this, I'm in the final weeks of completing my MBA at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

I have a beautful wife, and we just welcomed a newborn baby to the family. We also have a neurotic Dalmatian and an overweight cat running around and keeping life interesting.
